    <p>Assalam Alaikum</p>
    <p>
      Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for
      him many times over? (Surat Baqara, Verse 245)
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing,
      instills upon his men to give Qarz-Hasana because it is man's nature to be
      frugal whilst spending his wealth. Allah speaks about qarz because it is
      returned and Allah and promises that He will return the goodly loan by 70
      folds. Allah conveys his message to the Muslim ummah through the Holy
      Prophet Muhammad Prompting Muslims to spend their wealth in a certain way.
      He says, Oh children of Adam! Trust me with your wealth. If you do so, no
      fire, flood or thieves will be able to rob you off your money. Instead,
      you will be endowed with your wealth when you most need it. He further
      says that the poor and weak will not remain hungry and naked except due to
      negligence of the rich, who should complain to Allah and say that all
      those men on whom you graciously bestowed the rights of wealth showed
      accountability from those people but He will also punish them accordingly.
      On the Day of Judgement, the rich will be humiliated because they did not
      help the needy. The needy will complain to Allah and say that all those
      men on whom you graciously bestowed the rights of wealth showed negligence
      in its proper use; they were busy spending on themselves and forgot about
      us, the ones who needed it. Allah will reply to this and say: "I swear on
      my respect and glory! I will bring you closer to me and push them further
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alhamdulillah, Allah has accorded our organization with the highest favor
      by sending those people our way who follow the teachings of Holy Quran and
      Hadith, give zakat, fidyah, fitrah, khairat and other donations to help us
      those in need. The purpose of sending this message to you is so that you
      not only spread this message to others but also play your part in helping
      us to continue serving and helping the needy till the Day of Judgement.
