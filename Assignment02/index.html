    <h2>Semantic Elements</h2>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic
      <b>HTML</b> and Semantic <b>HTML</b>. The word semantic means
      <b><i>"relating to meaning"</i></b
      >, so semantic elements provide informatino about the content between the
      opning and closing tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;By using Semantic <b>HTML</b>, we select <b>HTML</b> elements
      based on their meaning, not on how they are presented. Elements such as
      <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;span&gt;</b> are not semantic elements since
      they provide no context as to what is inside those tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;For example, instead of using a <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> element to
      contain our header information, we could use a
      <b>&lt;header&gt;</b> element, which is used as a heading section. By
      using a <b>&lt;header&gt;</b> tag instead of a <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>, we
      provide context as to what information is inside of the opening and
      closing tag.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Use Semantic Elements?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Accessibility:</b> Semantic HTML makes webpags accessible for
          mobile devices and for people with disabilities as well. This is
          because screen readers and browsers are able to interpret the code
          better.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>SEO:</b> It improves the website <b>SEO</b> or <b>S</b>earch
          <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization, which is the process of increasing
          the number of people that visit your webpage. With better <b>SEO</b>,
          search engines are better able to identify the content of your website
          and weight the most important content appropriately.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Easy to Understand:</b> Semantic <b>HTML</b> also makes the
          website's source code easier to read for other web developers.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      &emsp;To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic
      <b>HTML</b> to going into a store with no signs on the aisles. However,
      stores that do have signs for each aisle make it a lot easier to find the
      items you need, just like Semantic <b>HTML</b>.

    <p>
      &emsp;Many websites contain <b>HTML</b> code like: <b>&lt;div id="header"&gt;, 
      &lt;div id="nav"&gt;, &lt;div id="main"&gt;, &lt;div id="footer"&gt;</b> to indicate 
      header, navigation, main content and footer.
